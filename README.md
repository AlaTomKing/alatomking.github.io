# alatomking.github.io
my html website with all the things you dont need

this projcet is actually licensed with mit license so u can copy and do anything u want as long as u include this license text in my project. nice

as you know, everything i made is unfinished, because i dont take being a developer very seriously. and im lazy

random facts:

what does alatomking stand for?
the name came from minecraft pocket edition in late 2016 because i tried to make my username green
i was called alatom without the king

the a in ala makes the text green if u add dis symbol <kbd>ยง</kbd> in front of it

the l makes the text <b>bold</b>

i added another a after the l on accident

its supposed to be a green bold tom but it showed up like alatom without this symbol <kbd>ยง</kbd>

i also think i made the first a capital idk why

then why is there king after alatom?

i played roblox at early 2017.

the username alatom was already taken so i randomly added the king at the end cuz i feel like it.

there isnt any specific reason about why king was chosen

i could be named AlaTomPlays or AlaTomWasTaken or smth like that

actually i think AlaTomKing just hits the spot
