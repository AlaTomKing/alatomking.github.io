## why
~~im a video game developer, speficially for roblox. but i know one or two about making games in other engines such as unity and godot.
unreal engine is too much for my laptop so idk about that~~
i consider myself as an developer now, because i try to learn to be versatile around platforms i like. so i am technically still a video game developer, but now i am also a web developer: front end and back end.

## what does 'alatomking' stand for?
the name came from minecraft pocket edition in late 2016 because i tried to make my name green and bold
i was called alatom without the king
the a in ala makes the text green if u add dis symbol <kbd>ยง</kbd> in front of it
the l makes the text <b>bold</b>
i added another a after the l on accident
its supposed to be a green bold tom but it showed up like alatom without this symbol <kbd>ยง</kbd>
i also think i made the first a capital idk why

expected result:

<span style="color: green">**Tom**</span>

actual result:

AlaTom

the name 'alatom' came completly on accident and i decided to keep it

### then why is there 'king' after alatom?

i played roblox at early 2017.

the username alatom was already taken so i randomly added the king at the end cuz i feel like it. 
there isnt any specific reason about why king was chosen 
i could be named AlaTomPlays or AlaTomWasTaken or smth like that actually 
i think AlaTomKing just hits the spot
